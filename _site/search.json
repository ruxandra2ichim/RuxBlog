    "text": "On November 20th I am going back to work.\nI was on maternity leave for a while, 1 year and a half to be more exact. Yes I know, by American standards this is inconceivable. But that also means I feel like I forgot everything I used to know about my job.\nI am an R&D Engineer in a field that is all the rave these days: Machine Learning.\nSo in an attempt to prepare for the new/old job, I started a course that I always meant to take but never felt I had the time for: https://www.fast.ai/. I truly recommend it.\nHonestly, I thought I would finish it by the end of my leave. Now I am pretty sure I won’t. If I was in a rush, I could probably listen to the lessons and feel like I know all those things. But I allowed myself the time to take it slow. And realized how much there is to learn and how the course changes your entire perspective on how to learn.\nI’ve been working in this field for a while now and I never thought it was that much fun. (Don’t tell my boss). But with this new learning mindset, I can’t wait to try new things. Or maybe I am just desperate for anything non-baby-related.\nSo to keep up with the fast.ai philosophy for learning, I will try to blog."
